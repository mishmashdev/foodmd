# FoodMD

FoodMD is an app that helps you figure out if you have any food allergies.
You keep track of the foods you eat each day. At the end of the day you rate
how you felt throughout the day. FoodMD will then try to figure which foods you
eat on the days you feel the worst.

The mockup folder contains just a simple mockup of how the app might work. It is
just a simple vanilla JavaScript app that doesn't do much right now. The real
version is going to be created using React.
